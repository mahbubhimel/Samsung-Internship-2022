# Wear OS 3 Health Services

In 2022, when everything is near at hand, health services are no difference. The usage of mobile apps for healthcare purposes have been skyrocketing day by day. 
People want every solution in a single piece of device. To serve the purpose, we're introducing Wear OS 3 which provides health services in a single place. 
The Health Services acts as an intermediary to the various sensors and related algorithms on the device to provide apps with high-quality data related to activity, exercise, and health.

The apps we use in our day-to-day life, serve a specific purpose. 
For example, an app for measuring the heart rate, an app for counting the burned calories in exercises or an app for calculating the distances covered in a running session. 
When all of these mentioned functionalities are combined it is undoubtedly an efficient and a unique experience for the users. 
Wear OS 3 Health Services automatically configure all fitness and health related sensors appropriately for the use-case, collect sensor data, and compute metrics like heart rate, distance, calories, elevation, floors, speed, pace, and more.
Apps can register for this data directly from Health Services.

It all comes down to offering functionalities in the most user-friendly way possible when it comes to healthcare apps. 
Although it might sound quite simple, only a small number of healthcare apps have really implemented these two crucial elements. 
To justify about satisfying these conditions, some benefits of the service can be mentioned-

- there are powerful algorithms running natively on the platform but ensuring less power consumption
- introducing both options- collecting data sampled at a single point in time and data taken over a time interval
- creating a goal state or event encouraging users to pursue certain goals
- While an exercise is in progress, Health Services can collect metrics on selected data types and report back to the app that is managing the exercise

Wear OS 3 is a wearable platform, helping people live more present, healthy, and productive lives. 
Wear OS makes smartwatches into glanceable, standalone devices, so users can stay connected online and complete tasks quickly, while leaving their phones in their pockets. 
These are a few but enticing features which makes it a user-friendly, purpose serving Health Service.
